<a name="l6"><span class="linenum">   6</span></a>   Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
<a name="l7"><span class="linenum">   7</span></a>   of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
<a name="l8"><span class="linenum">   8</span></a>  
<a name="l9"><span class="linenum">   9</span></a>                  Preamble
<a name="l10"><span class="linenum">  10</span></a>  
<a name="l11"><span class="linenum">  11</span></a>    The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
<a name="l12"><span class="linenum">  12</span></a>  freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
<a name="l13"><span class="linenum">  13</span></a>  License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
<a name="l14"><span class="linenum">  14</span></a>  software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
<a name="l15"><span class="linenum">  15</span></a>  General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
<a name="l16"><span class="linenum">  16</span></a>  Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
<a name="l17"><span class="linenum">  17</span></a>  using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
<a name="l18"><span class="linenum">  18</span></a>  the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
<a name="l19"><span class="linenum">  19</span></a>  your programs, too.
<a name="l20"><span class="linenum">  20</span></a>  
<a name="l21"><span class="linenum">  21</span></a>    When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
<a name="l22"><span class="linenum">  22</span></a>  price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
<a name="l23"><span class="linenum">  23</span></a>  have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
<a name="l24"><span class="linenum">  24</span></a>  this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
<a name="l25"><span class="linenum">  25</span></a>  if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
<a name="l26"><span class="linenum">  26</span></a>  in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
<a name="l27"><span class="linenum">  27</span></a>  
<a name="l28"><span class="linenum">  28</span></a>    To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
<a name="l29"><span class="linenum">  29</span></a>  anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
<a name="l30"><span class="linenum">  30</span></a>  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
<a name="l31"><span class="linenum">  31</span></a>  distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
<a name="l32"><span class="linenum">  32</span></a>  
<a name="l33"><span class="linenum">  33</span></a>    For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
<a name="l34"><span class="linenum">  34</span></a>  gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
<a name="l35"><span class="linenum">  35</span></a>  you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
<a name="l36"><span class="linenum">  36</span></a>  source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
<a name="l37"><span class="linenum">  37</span></a>  rights.
<a name="l38"><span class="linenum">  38</span></a>  
<a name="l39"><span class="linenum">  39</span></a>    We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
<a name="l40"><span class="linenum">  40</span></a>  (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
<a name="l41"><span class="linenum">  41</span></a>  distribute and/or modify the software.
<a name="l42"><span class="linenum">  42</span></a>  
<a name="l43"><span class="linenum">  43</span></a>    Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
<a name="l44"><span class="linenum">  44</span></a>  that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
<a name="l45"><span class="linenum">  45</span></a>  software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
<a name="l46"><span class="linenum">  46</span></a>  want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
<a name="l47"><span class="linenum">  47</span></a>  that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
<a name="l48"><span class="linenum">  48</span></a>  authors' reputations.
<a name="l49"><span class="linenum">  49</span></a>  
<a name="l50"><span class="linenum">  50</span></a>    Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
<a name="l51"><span class="linenum">  51</span></a>  patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
<a name="l52"><span class="linenum">  52</span></a>  program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
<a name="l53"><span class="linenum">  53</span></a>  program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
<a name="l54"><span class="linenum">  54</span></a>  patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
<a name="l55"><span class="linenum">  55</span></a>  
<a name="l56"><span class="linenum">  56</span></a>    The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
<a name="l57"><span class="linenum">  57</span></a>  modification follow.
<a name="l58"><span class="linenum">  58</span></a>  
<a name="l59"><span class="linenum">  59</span></a>              GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
<a name="l60"><span class="linenum">  60</span></a>     TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
<a name="l61"><span class="linenum">  61</span></a>  
<a name="l62"><span class="linenum">  62</span></a>    0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
<a name="l63"><span class="linenum">  63</span></a>  a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
<a name="l64"><span class="linenum">  64</span></a>  under the terms of this General Public License.  The &quot;Program&quot;, below,
<a name="l65"><span class="linenum">  65</span></a>  refers to any such program or work, and a &quot;work based on the Program&quot;
<a name="l66"><span class="linenum">  66</span></a>  means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
<a name="l67"><span class="linenum">  67</span></a>  that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
<a name="l68"><span class="linenum">  68</span></a>  either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
<a name="l69"><span class="linenum">  69</span></a>  language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
<a name="l70"><span class="linenum">  70</span></a>  the term &quot;modification&quot;.)  Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.
<a name="l71"><span class="linenum">  71</span></a>  
<a name="l72"><span class="linenum">  72</span></a>  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
<a name="l73"><span class="linenum">  73</span></a>  covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
<a name="l74"><span class="linenum">  74</span></a>  running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
<a name="l75"><span class="linenum">  75</span></a>  is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
<a name="l76"><span class="linenum">  76</span></a>  Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
<a name="l77"><span class="linenum">  77</span></a>  Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.
<a name="l78"><span class="linenum">  78</span></a>  
<a name="l79"><span class="linenum">  79</span></a>    1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
<a name="l80"><span class="linenum">  80</span></a>  source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
<a name="l81"><span class="linenum">  81</span></a>  conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
<a name="l82"><span class="linenum">  82</span></a>  copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
<a name="l83"><span class="linenum">  83</span></a>  notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
<a name="l84"><span class="linenum">  84</span></a>  and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
<a name="l85"><span class="linenum">  85</span></a>  along with the Program.
<a name="l86"><span class="linenum">  86</span></a>  
<a name="l87"><span class="linenum">  87</span></a>  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
<a name="l88"><span class="linenum">  88</span></a>  you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
<a name="l89"><span class="linenum">  89</span></a>  
<a name="l90"><span class="linenum">  90</span></a>    2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
<a name="l91"><span class="linenum">  91</span></a>  of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
<a name="l92"><span class="linenum">  92</span></a>  distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
<a name="l93"><span class="linenum">  93</span></a>  above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
<a name="l94"><span class="linenum">  94</span></a>  
<a name="l95"><span class="linenum">  95</span></a>      a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
<a name="l96"><span class="linenum">  96</span></a>      stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
<a name="l97"><span class="linenum">  97</span></a>  
<a name="l98"><span class="linenum">  98</span></a>      b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
<a name="l99"><span class="linenum">  99</span></a>      whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
<a name="l100"><span class="linenum"> 100</span></a>      part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
<a name="l101"><span class="linenum"> 101</span></a>      parties under the terms of this License.
<a name="l102"><span class="linenum"> 102</span></a>  
<a name="l103"><span class="linenum"> 103</span></a>      c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
<a name="l104"><span class="linenum"> 104</span></a>      when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
<a name="l105"><span class="linenum"> 105</span></a>      interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
<a name="l106"><span class="linenum"> 106</span></a>      announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
<a name="l107"><span class="linenum"> 107</span></a>      notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
<a name="l108"><span class="linenum"> 108</span></a>      a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
<a name="l109"><span class="linenum"> 109</span></a>      these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
<a name="l110"><span class="linenum"> 110</span></a>      License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
<a name="l111"><span class="linenum"> 111</span></a>      does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
<a name="l112"><span class="linenum"> 112</span></a>      the Program is not required to print an announcement.)
<a name="l113"><span class="linenum"> 113</span></a>  
<a name="l114"><span class="linenum"> 114</span></a>  These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
<a name="l115"><span class="linenum"> 115</span></a>  identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
<a name="l116"><span class="linenum"> 116</span></a>  and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
<a name="l117"><span class="linenum"> 117</span></a>  themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
<a name="l118"><span class="linenum"> 118</span></a>  sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
<a name="l119"><span class="linenum"> 119</span></a>  distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
<a name="l120"><span class="linenum"> 120</span></a>  on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
<a name="l121"><span class="linenum"> 121</span></a>  this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
<a name="l122"><span class="linenum"> 122</span></a>  entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
<a name="l123"><span class="linenum"> 123</span></a>  Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
<a name="l124"><span class="linenum"> 124</span></a>  your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
<a name="l125"><span class="linenum"> 125</span></a>  exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
<a name="l126"><span class="linenum"> 126</span></a>  collective works based on the Program.
<a name="l127"><span class="linenum"> 127</span></a>  
<a name="l128"><span class="linenum"> 128</span></a>  In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
<a name="l129"><span class="linenum"> 129</span></a>  with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
<a name="l130"><span class="linenum"> 130</span></a>  a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
<a name="l131"><span class="linenum"> 131</span></a>  the scope of this License.
<a name="l132"><span class="linenum"> 132</span></a>  
<a name="l133"><span class="linenum"> 133</span></a>    3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
<a name="l134"><span class="linenum"> 134</span></a>  under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
<a name="l135"><span class="linenum"> 135</span></a>  Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
<a name="l136"><span class="linenum"> 136</span></a>  
<a name="l137"><span class="linenum"> 137</span></a>      a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
<a name="l138"><span class="linenum"> 138</span></a>      source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
<a name="l139"><span class="linenum"> 139</span></a>      1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
<a name="l140"><span class="linenum"> 140</span></a>  
<a name="l141"><span class="linenum"> 141</span></a>      b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
<a name="l142"><span class="linenum"> 142</span></a>      years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
<a name="l143"><span class="linenum"> 143</span></a>      cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
<a name="l144"><span class="linenum"> 144</span></a>      machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
<a name="l145"><span class="linenum"> 145</span></a>      distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
<a name="l146"><span class="linenum"> 146</span></a>      customarily used for software interchange; or,
<a name="l147"><span class="linenum"> 147</span></a>  
<a name="l148"><span class="linenum"> 148</span></a>      c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
<a name="l149"><span class="linenum"> 149</span></a>      to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
<a name="l150"><span class="linenum"> 150</span></a>      allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
<a name="l151"><span class="linenum"> 151</span></a>      received the program in object code or executable form with such
<a name="l152"><span class="linenum"> 152</span></a>      an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)
<a name="l153"><span class="linenum"> 153</span></a>  
<a name="l154"><span class="linenum"> 154</span></a>  The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
<a name="l155"><span class="linenum"> 155</span></a>  making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
<a name="l156"><span class="linenum"> 156</span></a>  code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
<a name="l157"><span class="linenum"> 157</span></a>  associated <span class="keyword">interface </span><a class="class" onClick="logClass('definition')" href="../_classes/definition.html" onMouseOver="classPopup(event,'definition')">definition</a> files, plus the scripts used to
<a name="l158"><span class="linenum"> 158</span></a>  control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
<a name="l159"><span class="linenum"> 159</span></a>  special exception, the source code distributed need not include
<a name="l160"><span class="linenum"> 160</span></a>  anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
<a name="l161"><span class="linenum"> 161</span></a>  form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
<a name="l162"><span class="linenum"> 162</span></a>  operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
<a name="l163"><span class="linenum"> 163</span></a>  itself accompanies the executable.
<a name="l164"><span class="linenum"> 164</span></a>  
<a name="l165"><span class="linenum"> 165</span></a>  If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
<a name="l166"><span class="linenum"> 166</span></a>  access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
<a name="l167"><span class="linenum"> 167</span></a>  access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
<a name="l168"><span class="linenum"> 168</span></a>  distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
<a name="l169"><span class="linenum"> 169</span></a>  compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
<a name="l170"><span class="linenum"> 170</span></a>  
<a name="l171"><span class="linenum"> 171</span></a>    4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
<a name="l172"><span class="linenum"> 172</span></a>  except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
<a name="l173"><span class="linenum"> 173</span></a>  otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
<a name="l174"><span class="linenum"> 174</span></a>  void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
<a name="l175"><span class="linenum"> 175</span></a>  However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
<a name="l176"><span class="linenum"> 176</span></a>  this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
<a name="l177"><span class="linenum"> 177</span></a>  parties remain in full compliance.
<a name="l178"><span class="linenum"> 178</span></a>  
<a name="l179"><span class="linenum"> 179</span></a>    5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
<a name="l180"><span class="linenum"> 180</span></a>  signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
<a name="l181"><span class="linenum"> 181</span></a>  distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
<a name="l182"><span class="linenum"> 182</span></a>  prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
<a name="l183"><span class="linenum"> 183</span></a>  modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
<a name="l184"><span class="linenum"> 184</span></a>  Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
<a name="l185"><span class="linenum"> 185</span></a>  all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
<a name="l186"><span class="linenum"> 186</span></a>  the Program or works based on it.
<a name="l187"><span class="linenum"> 187</span></a>  
<a name="l188"><span class="linenum"> 188</span></a>    6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
<a name="l189"><span class="linenum"> 189</span></a>  Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
<a name="l190"><span class="linenum"> 190</span></a>  original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
<a name="l191"><span class="linenum"> 191</span></a>  these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
<a name="l192"><span class="linenum"> 192</span></a>  restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
<a name="l193"><span class="linenum"> 193</span></a>  You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
<a name="l194"><span class="linenum"> 194</span></a>  this License.
<a name="l195"><span class="linenum"> 195</span></a>  
<a name="l196"><span class="linenum"> 196</span></a>    7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
<a name="l197"><span class="linenum"> 197</span></a>  infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
<a name="l198"><span class="linenum"> 198</span></a>  conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
<a name="l199"><span class="linenum"> 199</span></a>  otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
<a name="l200"><span class="linenum"> 200</span></a>  excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
<a name="l201"><span class="linenum"> 201</span></a>  distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
<a name="l202"><span class="linenum"> 202</span></a>  License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
<a name="l203"><span class="linenum"> 203</span></a>  may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
<a name="l204"><span class="linenum"> 204</span></a>  license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
<a name="l205"><span class="linenum"> 205</span></a>  all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
<a name="l206"><span class="linenum"> 206</span></a>  the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
<a name="l207"><span class="linenum"> 207</span></a>  refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.
<a name="l208"><span class="linenum"> 208</span></a>  
<a name="l209"><span class="linenum"> 209</span></a>  If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
<a name="l210"><span class="linenum"> 210</span></a>  any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
<a name="l211"><span class="linenum"> 211</span></a>  apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
<a name="l212"><span class="linenum"> 212</span></a>  circumstances.
<a name="l213"><span class="linenum"> 213</span></a>  
<a name="l214"><span class="linenum"> 214</span></a>  It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
<a name="l215"><span class="linenum"> 215</span></a>  patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
<a name="l216"><span class="linenum"> 216</span></a>  such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
<a name="l217"><span class="linenum"> 217</span></a>  integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
<a name="l218"><span class="linenum"> 218</span></a>  implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
<a name="l219"><span class="linenum"> 219</span></a>  generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
<a name="l220"><span class="linenum"> 220</span></a>  through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
<a name="l221"><span class="linenum"> 221</span></a>  system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
<a name="l222"><span class="linenum"> 222</span></a>  to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
<a name="l223"><span class="linenum"> 223</span></a>  impose that choice.
<a name="l224"><span class="linenum"> 224</span></a>  
<a name="l225"><span class="linenum"> 225</span></a>  This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
<a name="l226"><span class="linenum"> 226</span></a>  be a consequence of the rest of this License.
<a name="l227"><span class="linenum"> 227</span></a>  
<a name="l228"><span class="linenum"> 228</span></a>    8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
<a name="l229"><span class="linenum"> 229</span></a>  certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
<a name="l230"><span class="linenum"> 230</span></a>  original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
<a name="l231"><span class="linenum"> 231</span></a>  may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
<a name="l232"><span class="linenum"> 232</span></a>  those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
<a name="l233"><span class="linenum"> 233</span></a>  countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
<a name="l234"><span class="linenum"> 234</span></a>  the limitation as if written in the body of this License.
<a name="l235"><span class="linenum"> 235</span></a>  
<a name="l236"><span class="linenum"> 236</span></a>    9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
<a name="l237"><span class="linenum"> 237</span></a>  of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
<a name="l238"><span class="linenum"> 238</span></a>  be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
<a name="l239"><span class="linenum"> 239</span></a>  address new problems or concerns.
<a name="l240"><span class="linenum"> 240</span></a>  
<a name="l241"><span class="linenum"> 241</span></a>  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
<a name="l242"><span class="linenum"> 242</span></a>  specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and &quot;any
<a name="l243"><span class="linenum"> 243</span></a>  later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and conditions
<a name="l244"><span class="linenum"> 244</span></a>  either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
<a name="l245"><span class="linenum"> 245</span></a>  Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
<a name="l246"><span class="linenum"> 246</span></a>  this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
<a name="l247"><span class="linenum"> 247</span></a>  Foundation.
<a name="l248"><span class="linenum"> 248</span></a>  
<a name="l249"><span class="linenum"> 249</span></a>    10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
<a name="l250"><span class="linenum"> 250</span></a>  programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
<a name="l251"><span class="linenum"> 251</span></a>  to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
<a name="l252"><span class="linenum"> 252</span></a>  Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
<a name="l253"><span class="linenum"> 253</span></a>  make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
<a name="l254"><span class="linenum"> 254</span></a>  of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
<a name="l255"><span class="linenum"> 255</span></a>  of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
<a name="l256"><span class="linenum"> 256</span></a>  
<a name="l257"><span class="linenum"> 257</span></a>                  NO WARRANTY
<a name="l258"><span class="linenum"> 258</span></a>  
<a name="l259"><span class="linenum"> 259</span></a>    11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
<a name="l260"><span class="linenum"> 260</span></a>  FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
<a name="l261"><span class="linenum"> 261</span></a>  OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
<a name="l262"><span class="linenum"> 262</span></a>  PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
<a name="l263"><span class="linenum"> 263</span></a>  OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
<a name="l264"><span class="linenum"> 264</span></a>  MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
<a name="l265"><span class="linenum"> 265</span></a>  TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
<a name="l266"><span class="linenum"> 266</span></a>  PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
<a name="l267"><span class="linenum"> 267</span></a>  REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
<a name="l268"><span class="linenum"> 268</span></a>  
<a name="l269"><span class="linenum"> 269</span></a>    12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
<a name="l270"><span class="linenum"> 270</span></a>  WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
<a name="l271"><span class="linenum"> 271</span></a>  REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
<a name="l272"><span class="linenum"> 272</span></a>  INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
<a name="l273"><span class="linenum"> 273</span></a>  OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
<a name="l274"><span class="linenum"> 274</span></a>  TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
<a name="l275"><span class="linenum"> 275</span></a>  YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
<a name="l276"><span class="linenum"> 276</span></a>  PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
<a name="l277"><span class="linenum"> 277</span></a>  POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
